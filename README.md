# Ticketing 
This project is designed to facilitate the selling of tickets to a large audience for various events such as concerts, sporting events, and theater performances.  
It provides an online platform for customers to purchase tickets easily and securely, without the need to physically visit a box office.   
The project can handle large volumes of traffic and transactions, ensuring that customers can quickly and efficiently purchase tickets without experiencing technical issues or delays.

In addition to ticket sales, the project also includes features such as seat selection and event information, providing customers with a comprehensive view of the event and their options.   
The project can also be customized to suit the specific needs of the event organizer, including branding, pricing, and promotional offers.   
By offering these capabilities, the project aims to simplify the ticket selling process and enhance the overall experience for both event organizers and customers.


This project employs a range of technologies to create a highly scalable and efficient system for microservices.

`Express` is a popular back-end web framework for Node.js that enables developers to build scalable and robust web applications. By using Express with TypeScript, the project can benefit from strong typing, which can help identify errors and improve code reliability.

The project also uses a message broker called `NATS`, which facilitates the communication between the microservices. This helps to create a loosely coupled system that is more resilient and scalable.

`JWT authentication` is used to secure the microservices, allowing only authorized users to access certain parts of the application. This provides an additional layer of security for the microservices and helps to protect sensitive data.

The project is built using microservices architecture, which involves breaking the application down into smaller, independent services that can communicate with each other. This enables better scalability, as individual services can be scaled up or down as needed.

The use of `Docker` and `Kubernetes` helps to make the deployment and management of the microservices more efficient and streamlined. Docker containers can be easily created and managed, while Kubernetes automates the scaling and deployment of these containers.

`MongoDB`, a NoSQL database that is highly scalable and efficient. This allows the microservices to store and retrieve data quickly and reliably, ensuring that the application can handle large amounts of data without experiencing performance issues.

To deploy the microservices application locally using Skaffold, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Install the required tools:

   - Docker Desktop: This will allow you to build and run Docker containers locally.
   - Kubernetes CLI: This is used to manage the local Kubernetes cluster.
   - Skaffold: This is used to build and deploy the application.
2.  Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory of the project.

3. Start the local Kubernetes cluster by running the following command: ```kubectl apply -f k8s``` 

4. Start Skaffold by running the following command: ```skaffold dev```  
Skaffold will then build and deploy the application to the local Kubernetes cluster. Once the deployment is complete, you can access the application by visiting http://localhost in your web browser.

To stop the application, simply press Ctrl + C in the terminal window where Skaffold is running.

By following these steps, you can quickly and easily deploy the microservices application locally using Skaffold and a local Kubernetes cluster. This allows you to test and debug the application in a development environment, before deploying it to a production environment.
